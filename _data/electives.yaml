  textbook: NA
  description: >
    This course covers the technologies, protocols and architectures of the Internet. A major focus of this
    course is the technology and the drive towards Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), web services and ebusiness.
    To achieve this, we will examine the extensible markup language (XML) and associated
    technologies as well as JSON and REST based technologies. This is followed by exploring the
    technology used in web services such as web services description language (WSDL), simple object access
    protocol (SOAP), universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI). With this background, we will
    look at the concept of semantic web as well as the technologies that are being used in it. Simultaneously,
    another aspect of the course will look at Java-script and AJAX (Asynchronous Java-script And XML) that
    are used to deliver modern web-based and mobile applications. nical skillsets are vital for students
    seeking to start businesses or engage in scientific research.

  name: Distributed and Parallel Database Systems
  textbook: fun
  description: >
    This course covers the principles and system organization of distributed and parallel databases. It
    focuses on issues of Database System Architectures, Database Design and Query Optimization in
    Distributed and Parallel Database Systems. Emphasis is also placed on the fundamentals of Enterprise
    Database Systems.

  name: Computational Statistics I
  textbook: fun
  description: >
    This course is meant to cover the basics methods in computational statistics. Techniques such as
    bootstrap, jack-knife, MCMC with particular reference to both hierarchical Bayesian and
    Empirical Bayes will be covered. The theoretical underpinnings of the course will be covered in
    conjunction with relevant computational aspects. The course will be hands on and practical and
    will rely heavily on the statistical software R. Matlab will be utilized where there is a need for
    numerical computations. We will rely on both real data and simulated data for illustrating the
    main concepts in the course. Datasets from different subject areas will be utilized. The course is
    the first in a sequence of two computational statistics courses, which can be done separately.

  name: Computational Statistics II
  textbook: NA
  description: >
    This course is meant to cover the techniques in statistics that are computational in nature that
    would not have ordinarily been covered by the other courses in the Statistics masters program.
    The course covers topics such as spatial statistics, advanced Bayesian models and some data
    mining techniques. Both the theoretical underpinnings of the material and the application
    through computational aspects will be covered. The course will be hands on and practical and
    will rely heavily on the statistical software R. Matlab will be utilized where there is a need for
    numerical computations. We will rely on both real data and simulated data for illustrating the
    main concepts in the course. Datasets from different subject areas will be utilized. The course is
    the second in a sequence of two computational statistics courses

  name: Data Analysis
  textbook: fun
  description: >
    This is a course on getting the most out of data. The emphasis will be on hands-on experience,
    involving case studies with real data and using common statistical packages i.e. R, SPSS and
    STATA. The course covers, at a very high level, exploratory data analysis, model formulation,
    goodness of fit testing, and other standard and non-standard statistical procedures, categorical
    data, generalized linear models, survival analysis, and modern regression methods. Students will
    be expected to propose a data set of their choice for use as case study material.

  name: Multivariate Analysis
  textbook: na
  description: >
    This course provides graduate students with a set of statistical tools and methods that will enable
    them to analyze multivariate data properly using sound statistical methods and appropriate
    computer software. Possible topics to be covered include multivariate data screening, principal
    component analysis, MANOVA, MANCOVA, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis,
    multidimensional scaling, factor analysis and structural equation modeling. All methods will be
    illustrated via real data sets, using the open source statistical software R. This course will also
    expose students to use of statistical software such as Minitab, SPSS and JMP and STATA.
