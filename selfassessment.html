    </ul>
<p>
Since we consider candidates with various backgrounds, there will be cases where a candidate may be lacking in one or more skills.
In such cases we suggest that the candidate contact us before submitting an application so we can advise them on how they can acquire the missing skills.
We may suggest that they take one or more online courses. On completion of such courses we will interview them to ensure that they have the skills required for the program.
They can then submit their application. Examples of courses we may recommend include Coursera Courses such as:
